# Guide to Natasha's Law: What Every Food Business Needs to Know üá¨üáß

Natasha's Law is a crucial piece of UK food safety legislation that affects every food business. Understanding and complying with this law is essential for protecting your customers and avoiding legal consequences.

In this comprehensive guide, we'll cover everything you need to know about Natasha's Law, from what it is to how to implement compliant labeling in your business.

---

## What is Natasha's Law?

**Natasha's Law** is named after Natasha Ednan-Laperouse, a teenager who tragically passed away in 2016 after suffering a fatal allergic reaction to undeclared sesame seeds in a baguette. Her story highlighted the urgent need for clearer allergen labeling in food.

The law requires that all **prepacked for direct sale (PPDS)** food includes a full list of ingredients and highlights allergens.

### The Legal Framework:

- **Enacted:** October 2021
- **Scope:** All UK food businesses
- **Penalties:** Up to ¬£10,000 fines and potential prosecution
- **Enforcement:** Local authorities and Environmental Health Officers (EHOs)

---

### What Counts as PPDS Food?

**PPDS food** is any food that is:

- **Made and packed** on the same premises where it's being sold
- **Prepacked before** the customer orders it

#### Examples of PPDS Food:

ü•™ **Sandwiches** made on-site and wrapped before sale
ü•§ **Smoothies** pre-bottled in-store
ü•ó **Salads** prepared in advance and displayed in a fridge
üç∞ **Cakes** and pastries packaged for display
ü•™ **Wraps** and paninis made ahead of time
üç± **Meal deals** and lunch boxes
ü•§ **Drinks** bottled or packaged in-store

#### What's NOT PPDS:

- Food made to order (like a custom sandwich)
- Food packaged at the point of sale
- Food made off-premises and delivered
- Food sold loose (like bakery items without packaging)

**Simple rule:** If the customer can pick it up without it being freshly packaged at the point of order, it's PPDS.

---

### What Must Be on the Label?

Under Natasha's Law, every PPDS label must include:

#### **1. Full List of Ingredients**

- **All ingredients** in descending order of weight
- **No hidden ingredients** - everything must be declared
- **Clear ingredient names** that customers can understand

#### **2. Clear Allergen Information**

The **14 major allergens** must be highlighted using one of these methods:

- **Bold text**
- **CAPITAL LETTERS**
- **Different colour**
- **Underlined text**

#### **3. The 14 Major Allergens:**

1. **Celery** (including celeriac)
2. **Cereals containing gluten** (wheat, rye, barley, oats)
3. **Crustaceans** (crab, lobster, prawns)
4. **Eggs**
5. **Fish**
6. **Lupin** (lupin seeds and flour)
7. **Milk**
8. **Molluscs** (mussels, oysters, squid)
9. **Mustard**
10. **Peanuts**
11. **Sesame**
12. **Soybeans**
13. **Sulphur dioxide/sulphites** (at levels above 10mg/kg)
14. **Tree nuts** (almonds, hazelnuts, walnuts, cashews, etc.)

#### **4. Label Format Requirements:**

- **Clear and legible** text
- **Durable** labels that won't fade or smudge
- **Prominent placement** on the packaging
- **Consistent formatting** across all products
