# 10 Essential Food Safety Labels Every Restaurant Needs 🍽️

Labels aren't just stickers—they're lifesavers in every kitchen. From preventing allergic reactions to avoiding costly expiry mishaps, a good label does way more than just sit pretty on a container.

Here's your no-fluff list of **10 labels every restaurant absolutely needs** (and yes, we're side-eyeing anyone still rocking masking tape and a Sharpie 😅).

---

## 1. 🕓 Use By Date Labels

No chef should ever have to guess if something's safe to serve. These labels clearly show the last safe day to use or serve a product. Say goodbye to "smell tests" and hello to confidence.

---

### 2. 🥣 Prep Date Labels

Keep track of when ingredients or dishes were prepped. FIFO (First In, First Out) only works if you know what came first. Prep dates keep your kitchen running like clockwork.

---

### 3. ⚠️ Allergen Labels

Just one peanut can ruin someone's day—and your reputation. Clearly mark allergens to protect customers and stay compliant with food safety laws. No shortcuts here.

---

### 4. 🧾 Ingredient Labels

Perfect for grab-and-go items or pre-packaged foods. Listing ingredients boosts transparency, helps with allergy management, and makes audits easier.

---

### 5. ❄️ Storage Instruction Labels

Does this go in the fridge or freezer? Should it stay dry? Proper storage instructions prevent spoilage and keep quality intact.

---

### 6. 🌬️ Thaw Date Labels

Keep tabs on when frozen items were moved to the fridge. This helps prevent over-aging and food waste from forgotten thawed items.

---

### 7. 🔥 Cooked Date Labels

Bulk cooking? Mark when items were cooked so you know how long they can safely be stored. No more mystery containers lurking in the walk-in!

---

### 8. ⏳ Expiration Date Labels

Track quality for longer-lasting ingredients like spices and sauces. Don't let your flavors fade away unnoticed.

---

### 9. #️⃣ Batch Number Labels

Essential for traceability—especially during recalls or quality checks. Batch numbers keep your kitchen audit-friendly and your chefs in control.

---

### 10. ✍️ Employee Initials Labels

Accountability in a label. Know who prepped what and when, making it easier to address issues and keep standards high.

---

### Why Are These Labels So Important? 🤔

Here's the bottom line:

✅ Stop foodborne illness before it starts  
✅ Stay compliant with regulations like Natasha's Law  
✅ Speed up kitchen workflows and reduce errors  
✅ Slash food waste and save money 💸
