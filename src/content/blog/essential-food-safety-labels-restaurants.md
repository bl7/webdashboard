# 10 Essential Food Safety Labels Every Restaurant Needs 🍽️

Labels aren’t just stickers—they’re lifesavers in the kitchen. From preventing allergic reactions to dodging expiry disasters, a good label does more than sit pretty on a container.

Here’s your no-fluff list of **10 labels every restaurant absolutely needs** (and yes, we’re judging you if you’re still using masking tape and a Sharpie 😅).

---

## 1. 🕓 Use By Date Labels  
**“Still good?”** isn't a question your chef should ever ask. These labels tell your team the last safe day to serve an item. No guessing, no gut-feeling roulette.

---

## 2. 🥣 Prep Date Labels  
Know exactly when that sauce was whipped up or the salad was chopped. FIFO (First In, First Out) only works if you know what came first!

---

## 3. ⚠️ Allergen Labels  
One peanut can ruin someone’s day. Highlight common allergens so your staff—and your customers—can stay safe. It’s also legally required in many places. No excuses.

---

## 4. 🧾 Ingredient Labels  
Great for grab-and-go or pre-packaged items. Show exactly what’s inside. Transparency = trust. Also, a lifesaver for allergy management and audits.

---

## 5. ❄️ Storage Instruction Labels  
Fridge or freezer? "Cold and dry place" or "don’t even think of freezing"? These labels make sure every item lands in the right home.

---

## 6. 🌬️ Thaw Date Labels  
Frozen chicken sitting in the fridge for 3 days? Not ideal. These labels keep track of when you moved something from the freezer so it doesn’t overstay its welcome.

---

## 7. 🔥 Cooked Date Labels  
Great for bulk prepped items. Mark when it was cooked so you know how long it’s safe to keep. No more mystery containers in the walk-in.

---

## 8. ⏳ Expiration Date Labels  
Helps track quality—not just safety. Useful for spices, sauces, and long-shelf-life items. Don’t let flavor die a slow, unnoticed death.

---

## 9. #️⃣ Batch Number Labels  
Need to trace something back? These help you identify batches, especially useful during recalls or prep reviews. Audit-friendly and chef-approved.

---

## 10. ✍️ Employee Initials Labels  
“Who prepped this?” → "Oh, that was Maya." Add accountability to your kitchen with initials. It’s a small label that builds big responsibility.

---

## Why Bother With All This? 🤔

Good question. Here’s the answer:

✅ Stops foodborne illness in its tracks  
✅ Keeps you compliant with laws (like Natasha’s Law in the UK)  
✅ Makes kitchens faster, cleaner, and smarter  
✅ Reduces waste = saves money 💸
