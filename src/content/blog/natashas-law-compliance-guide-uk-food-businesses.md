# Natasha's Law Compliance Guide: Complete UK Food Business Requirements 2025

Since October 2021, Natasha's Law has transformed how UK food businesses handle allergen labeling. This comprehensive guide explains everything you need to know about PPDS (Prepacked for Direct Sale) compliance and how InstaLabel software makes it effortless.

## What is Natasha's Law?

Natasha's Law, officially known as the Food Information (Amendment) (England) Regulations 2019, was introduced following the tragic death of Natasha Ednan-Laperouse in 2016. The law requires all food businesses to provide detailed allergen information on prepacked for direct sale (PPDS) foods.

### Key Requirements

- **Full Ingredient List**: All ingredients must be clearly listed
- **Allergen Highlighting**: 14 major allergens must be prominently displayed
- **Clear Formatting**: Information must be easily readable
- **Compliance Deadline**: October 1, 2021
- **Enforcement**: Local authorities and EHO inspections

## The 14 Major Allergens

UK food businesses must identify and highlight these allergens:

1. **Cereals containing gluten** (wheat, rye, barley, oats)
2. **Crustaceans** (crab, lobster, prawns)
3. **Eggs**
4. **Fish**
5. **Peanuts**
6. **Soybeans**
7. **Milk**
8. **Nuts** (almonds, hazelnuts, walnuts, cashews, pistachios, brazil nuts, macadamia nuts, pecans)
9. **Celery**
10. **Mustard**
11. **Sesame seeds**
12. **Sulphur dioxide/sulphites**
13. **Lupin**
14. **Molluscs** (mussels, oysters, scallops, clams)

## PPDS Food Definition

PPDS foods are items that:

- Are packaged before being offered for sale
- Are packaged at the same place they are offered for sale
- Are packaged in a way that prevents the contents from being altered without opening or changing the packaging

### Examples of PPDS Foods

- **Sandwiches** made and wrapped on-site
- **Salads** prepared and packaged in advance
- **Cakes** baked and boxed for sale
- **Ready meals** prepared and packaged
- **Deli items** packaged for customer convenience

## Traditional Compliance Challenges

### Manual Labeling Problems

- **Time-Consuming**: 20-30 minutes per label
- **Error-Prone**: Manual ingredient analysis
- **Inconsistent**: Different staff create different formats
- **Compliance Risk**: Missed allergens or incomplete information
- **Training Required**: Ongoing staff education needed

### Common Compliance Failures

- **Missing Allergens**: Incomplete ingredient analysis
