## What is HACCP?

HACCP is a management system designed to proactively identify biological, chemical, and physical hazards — from raw ingredients to finished food — and control them to prevent foodborne illness.

It covers every stage: sourcing, handling, cooking, storage, and serving.

### The 7 Principles of HACCP

1. **Conduct a Hazard Analysis**  
   Identify potential hazards that could occur at each step of your food process.

2. **Determine Critical Control Points (CCPs)**  
   Points where control is essential to prevent or eliminate hazards.

3. **Establish Critical Limits**  
   Set maximum or minimum values (e.g., temperature, time) for each CCP.

4. **Establish Monitoring Procedures**  
   Define how and when you will check CCPs to ensure they stay within limits.

5. **Establish Corrective Actions**  
   Plan what to do if monitoring shows a CCP is out of control.

6. **Establish Verification Procedures**  
   Confirm that your HACCP system is working effectively.

7. **Establish Record-Keeping and Documentation**  
   Maintain detailed logs and documents as proof of compliance and for audits.

### How to Implement HACCP in Your Kitchen

1. **Assemble a HACCP Team**  
   Gather knowledgeable staff from different kitchen areas.

2. **Describe the Food and Its Distribution**  
   Document your menu items and how they move through your kitchen.

3. **Identify Intended Use and Consumers**  
   Understand who your customers are and how they will use the food.

4. **Construct Flow Diagrams**  
   Map out each step of food preparation and handling.

5. **On-Site Confirmation of Flow Diagrams**  
   Verify the accuracy of your flow charts by observing operations.

6. **Conduct Hazard Analysis and Identify CCPs**  
   Analyze risks and pinpoint critical control points.

7. **Establish Monitoring and Corrective Actions**  
   Define how to track CCPs and respond to deviations.
