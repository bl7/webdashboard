👥 ABOUT PAGE – Rewritten Copy
Headline:
Built by food people. For food people.

Our Story:
InstaLabel started in a small café that struggled with handwritten labels, food waste, and expired ingredients. We watched kitchen staff lose time — and managers panic during surprise inspections.

So, we built a simple, bulletproof system for labeling and tracking kitchen inventory. It’s now used in over 1,500 UK kitchens — and growing fast.

Our Mission:
To help every kitchen label smarter, waste less, and stay compliant — without slowing down.
