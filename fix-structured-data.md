# Fix Google Search Console Merchant Listings Issues

## ✅ **All Files Fixed - Offer Structured Data Removed:**

- `src/app/(web)/plan/page.tsx` ✅ - Removed all pricing offers
- `src/app/(web)/page.tsx` ✅ - Removed homepage offer
- `src/app/layout.tsx` ✅ - Removed both offers
- `src/app/(web)/bookdemo/page.tsx` ✅ - Removed demo offer

- `src/app/(web)/allergen-compliance/page.tsx` ✅ - Removed compliance kit offer
- `src/app/(web)/square-integration/page.tsx` ✅ - Removed integration offer

## 🎯 **What This Fixes:**

- ❌ **Missing field "image"** → ✅ **Eliminated (no more offers)**
- ❌ **Missing "hasMerchantReturnPolicy"** → ✅ **Eliminated (no more offers)**
- ❌ **Missing "shippingDetails"** → ✅ **Eliminated (no more offers)**

## 🚀 **Result:**

- **All merchant listings errors** are now eliminated
- **No more Offer structured data** to cause issues
- **Cleaner, simpler structured data** for better SEO
- **Google Search Console** should stop complaining about merchant listings

## 💡 **Why This Approach Works:**

Since you don't need Google Shopping features, removing all Offer structured data is the **cleanest solution**. This eliminates the source of the errors entirely rather than trying to fix incomplete data.

## 📋 **Next Steps:**

1. **Deploy these changes**
2. **Wait 24-48 hours** for Google to re-crawl
3. **Check Google Search Console** - merchant listings errors should be gone
4. **Monitor for any new structured data issues**

## 🎉 **Status: COMPLETE**

All Offer structured data has been removed from your codebase. The merchant listings errors should be resolved after Google re-crawls your updated pages.
